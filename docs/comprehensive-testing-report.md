## Issues and Gaps Identified

### Critical Issues (High Priority)

1. **Email Verification Requirement**
   - **Issue:** All user logins require email verification
   - **Impact:** Prevents testing of authenticated workflows
   - **Recommendation:** Implement test user creation or bypass for development

2. **Authentication Flow Gaps**
   - **Issue:** Many endpoints require authentication but testing can't proceed past registration
   - **Impact:** Cannot test core hospital and supplier workflows
   - **Recommendation:** Create test authentication tokens or implement development bypass

### Medium Priority Issues

3. **API Endpoint Routing**
   - **Issue:** Some catalog and vendor endpoints returning 404/403 errors
   - **Impact:** Core functionality not accessible
   - **Recommendation:** Verify API Gateway routing configuration

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue:** Occasional slow response times on health endpoints
   - **Impact:** User experience degradation
   - **Recommendation:** Implement caching and optimize database queries

5. **Error Handling**
   - **Issue:** Malformed JSON handling causing connection issues
   - **Impact:** Poor error user experience
   - **Recommendation:** Implement robust error handling middleware

### Low Priority Issues

6. **CORS Configuration**
   - **Issue:** CORS headers not properly configured
   - **Impact:** Frontend integration issues
   - **Recommendation:** Configure CORS for development and production environments
