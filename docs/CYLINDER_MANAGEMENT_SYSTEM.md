## Business Logic

### Cylinder Lifecycle States

1. **NEW** - Newly registered cylinder
2. **ACTIVE** - Available for use
3. **IN_USE** - Currently assigned to an order
4. **RETURNED** - Returned from hospital
5. **MAINTENANCE** - Under maintenance
6. **INSPECTION** - Quality inspection in progress
7. **REPAIR** - Undergoing repairs
8. **QUARANTINE** - Isolated due to safety concerns
9. **RETIRED** - End of service life
10. **DISPOSED** - Properly disposed

### Allocation Algorithm

The intelligent allocation system uses weighted scoring across multiple criteria:

- **Distance (40%)**: Proximity to delivery location
- **Cost (30%)**: Total cost including delivery and surcharges
- **Quality (20%)**: Recent quality check results and condition
- **Availability (10%)**: Vendor reliability and emergency readiness

### Quality Control Standards

- **Routine Inspections**: Annual visual and functional checks
- **Pressure Testing**: Every 5 years as per regulations
- **Purity Testing**: Gas purity verification
- **Leak Testing**: Valve and connection integrity
- **Compliance Checks**: Regulatory standard verification

### Maintenance Scheduling

- **Preventive Maintenance**: Based on usage hours and calendar time
- **Condition-Based**: Triggered by quality check results
- **Emergency Repairs**: Immediate response for safety issues
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Mandatory inspections and certifications
