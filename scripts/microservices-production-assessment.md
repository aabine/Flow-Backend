```bash
# Debug User Service startup
docker logs flow-backend_user-service --tail 50
docker-compose build user-service
docker-compose up -d user-service
```

#### **2. Fix API Gateway (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# Debug API Gateway startup
docker logs flow-backend_api-gateway --tail 50
docker-compose build api-gateway

## **🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate (Next 24 Hours)**
1. **Fix User Service and API Gateway** - Platform cannot function without these
2. **Resolve Pricing Service Docker issues** - Important for order processing
3. **Stabilize database connections** - Critical for service health

### **Short Term (Next Week)**
1. **Apply production enhancements** to all remaining services
2. **Implement comprehensive testing** across all services
3. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for all services

### **Medium Term (Next Month)**
1. **Performance optimization** across all services
2. **Advanced security features** implementation
3. **Disaster recovery** and backup procedures

---

## **🏁 CONCLUSION**

While significant progress has been made with the Order and Inventory services achieving production-ready status, **immediate action is required** to bring the remaining services to the same standard. The platform has a solid foundation but needs focused effort on:

1. **Service Stability** - Fix crashed services
2. **Authentication Infrastructure** - Restore User Service
3. **API Gateway** - Enable external access
4. **Consistent Production Standards** - Apply enhancements across all services

**Estimated Time to Full Production Readiness**: 1-2 weeks with focused effort

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until at least User Service, API Gateway, and Pricing Service are operational and stable.
